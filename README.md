# Mask Detection and Segmentation
_This is an Artificial Intelligence Project created to detect whether a person is wearing a Mask or not, besides, using segmentation the model detect the borders of the mask. The model used for Mask Detection was the Resnet50 and for Mask Segmentation was Coco._

## Testing the models

### Mask Detection
